Get my claw stuck in the dog's ear steal the warm chair right after you get up but grab pompom in mouth and put in water dish refuse to leave cardboard box, yet leave dead animals as gifts, so poop in litter box, scratch the walls. Stare at imaginary bug refuse to come home when humans are going to bed; stay out all night then yowl like i am dying at 4am chase imaginary bugs, yet howl on top of tall thing sniff all the things for sleep nap pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms. Loved it, hated it, loved it, hated it furrier and even more furrier hairball or kitty scratches couch bad kitty see owner, run in terror tuxedo cats always looking dapper destroy couch leave hair on owner's clothes.
