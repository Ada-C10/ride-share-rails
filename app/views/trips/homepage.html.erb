        <h4>Why Rideshare</h4>
        <div class="buttonContainer"><%= link_to "Become A Driver", new_driver_path, class: "button" %></div>
        <p><strong>Why become a Driver:</strong> You can drive and earn as much as you want. And, the more you drive, the more you’ll make. Plus, you’ll get paid weekly and your fares get automatically deposited. Only drive when it works for you. There’s no office and no boss. That means you’ll always start and stop on your time—because with Uber, you’re in charge</p>

        <div class="buttonContainer"><%= link_to "Ride With Us", new_passenger_path, class: "button" %></div>
        <p><strong>Perks as a Passenger:</strong> Hate driving into the city to find parking? Rideshare makes it easier for you to get where you going without the hassel of looking for parking. Grab a ride from anywhere in a matter of minutes!</p>
